== Description ==

Marin is a lean full-site-editing (FSE) theme for WooCommerce stores, built to speed up client
e-commerce builds. It provides a design system via `theme.json` (colors, typography, spacing,
layout), WooCommerce block templates, and style variations. It ships a single page pattern, a store
front page built from Aludra blocks; other page content is composed directly from blocks. Marin is created from the Aviendha starter theme.

Marin pairs with the [Aludra](https://github.com/imagewize/aludra) block library (mega menu,
carousel, FAQ tabs, and more), but doesn't require it — the theme is a plain block theme that
works with core blocks and any block plugin. WooCommerce is needed for the store templates.

= Key Features =

* Full Site Editing (FSE) theme for WooCommerce stores
* Solid design system via `theme.json` (colors, typography, spacing, layout)
* WooCommerce block templates for single product and product archive
* Style variations: Twilight (dark) and Store (warm retail palette, self-hosted fonts)
* One page pattern (Store Home, needs Aludra and WooCommerce) — otherwise block-first composition
* Pairs with the Aludra block library (mega menu, carousel, FAQ tabs, and more)
* Translation-ready

== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme folder to `/wp-content/themes/`, or install via Appearance → Themes → Add New.
2. Activate the theme through the 'Appearance' menu in WordPress.
3. Optionally install and activate the Aludra plugin for mega menu, carousel, and other blocks.
4. Install and activate WooCommerce for store functionality.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2.0 =
* Added: Store Home page pattern, a front page built from Aludra blocks and a WooCommerce product grid. It is hidden unless WooCommerce is active and the Aludra plugin is installed.
* Changed: documentation now describes the single page pattern.

= 1.1.0 =
* Added: header product search, an icon-only search limited to products, in both header parts.
* Changed: the inherited "Start a project" button is removed from both headers.

= 1.0.4 =
* Changed: README documents Composer installation from Packagist and its file structure is corrected.

= 1.0.3 =
* Fixed: the npm lockfile carried an inherited version number; it now matches the theme version.

= 1.0.2 =
* Changed: package metadata and README now describe Marin as a WooCommerce e-commerce theme rather than a generic starter.

= 1.0.1 =
* Changed: a Winespring logo mark (grape cluster, Material Design Icons) replaces the inherited Aviendha rose, with a dark-mode variant for the README.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release. Created from Aviendha 1.18.4 and focused on WooCommerce stores.
* Added: a Store style variation — cream, charcoal and rust-orange with Cormorant Garamond headings and Jost body copy — mapped onto the full palette contract so Aludra blocks and store patterns render in it. Fonts are self-hosted and load only with the style.

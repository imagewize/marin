A lean full-site-editing starter theme for WordPress.
</div>

## Description

Aviendha is a full-site-editing (FSE) WordPress starter theme. It provides a solid design system via `theme.json` (colors, typography, spacing, layout), WooCommerce block templates, and style variations, but ships **no bundled patterns** — pages are composed directly from blocks. It is intended as a base theme to fork from, similar to Sage in the classic theming world.

Unlike Imagewize's [Elayne](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne) theme, Aviendha is minimal by design. It pairs with the [Aludra](https://github.com/imagewize/aludra) block library (mega menu, carousel, FAQ tabs, and more), but doesn't require it — the theme is a plain block theme that works with core blocks and any block plugin.

> **Lineage:** Aviendha is a companion starter theme to Imagewize's [Elayne](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne) and [Nynaeve](https://github.com/imagewize/nynaeve) themes, and serves as the base for themes like [Ixian](https://github.com/imagewize/ixian). Like Elayne, it ships no custom blocks of its own — content blocks come from the shared [Aludra](https://github.com/imagewize/aludra) plugin, per WordPress.org's theme-review rules. (Nynaeve is a separate case: it registers its own blocks and doesn't use Aludra.)

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.6+
- PHP 8.0+
- WooCommerce (optional, for store templates)
- Aludra plugin (recommended, not required)

## Features

- **Starter theme foundation** — designed to be forked and customized, with a clean separation of concerns and no opinionated patterns that would need removal
- **Design system** — `theme.json` defines the color palette, typography, spacing, and border radii; color/spacing slugs match what Aludra's own block styles expect (`base`, `contrast`, `secondary`, `main`, `primary`, `accent`, `tertiary`, `border-light`)
- **WooCommerce templates** — `templates/single-product.html`, `templates/archive-product.html`, `templates/product-search-results.html`, and `templates/coming-soon.html` are theme-provided; cart, checkout, and category-archive templates fall back to WooCommerce's own block-theme defaults. The product archive and search results ship a results count, catalog sorting, a filters sidebar (price, category, availability, rating) and an empty state; the single product template uses the block-based add to cart, with theme layouts for simple and variable products in `parts/`. The coming-soon template wraps WooCommerce's coming-soon block with the theme's header and footer.
- **Degrades gracefully without WooCommerce** — with the plugin inactive, the store templates and the header's mini cart are filtered out rather than left to render as unsupported blocks. WooCommerce's own bundled `woocommerce-blocks/*` patterns are unregistered when it *is* active — the theme neither designed nor styles them, and they crowd out core's.
- **Two page templates** — `page.html` (default) omits `post-title` since most pages get their title from a block's own heading; `page-with-title.html` (selectable per-page under Page → Template) adds the conventional title treatment.
- **Style variations** — see `styles/` (e.g. `twilight.json`) for alternate color palettes on top of the same design system.
- **No bundled patterns** — block-first composition. Core's own patterns stay registered, so the inserter is never empty; insert `aludra/*` blocks (or core blocks) directly into pages and templates, then add your own patterns as needed.

## Forking this theme

Aviendha is a GitHub [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Press **Use this template → Create a new repository**, then in the new repo run **Actions → Rename theme from template → Run workflow**. GitHub fires no workflow event when a repository is created from a template, so this one step is manual; everything after it is not.

The workflow opens a pull request replacing every mechanical `aviendha`/`Aviendha` identifier with your repository's name — CSS class prefixes (`aviendha-header`, `aviendha-eyebrow`, …), the PHP namespace and `aviendha_*` function prefix, the text domain, the PHPCS prefix rule, the Composer and npm package names, and the logo SVG filenames. Review the PR and merge it. It carries no CI checks: pull requests opened with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't trigger workflow runs, so Theme Check and WPCS first run on the push to `main` once you merge.

If the run fails to open a pull request, enable **Settings → Actions → General → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** in the new repository and run it again.

A single-word repository name (`ixian`) maps cleanly. A hyphenated one (`blue-desert`) yields `bluedesert_setup()` and `Theme Name: BlueDesert` — valid, but fix the human-readable name in `style.css` by hand.

The rename deliberately skips this README, `CHANGELOG.md`, `readme.txt` and the agent guides, which should still name Aviendha as the theme's lineage. Finish the fork by hand:

- Rewrite `README.md`, `readme.txt` and `CHANGELOG.md` for the new theme, and reset the version to `1.0.0` in `style.css`, `readme.txt`, `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Repoint the logo paths in those skipped files.** The workflow renames `assets/logos/aviendha-rose-*.svg` but not the references to them, so the README's header image (`<img src="assets/logos/aviendha-rose-primary.svg">`) renders broken, and the credits section of `readme.txt` — which *does* ship in the theme zip — cites paths that no longer exist.
- Update the `style.css` header — Theme Name, Theme URI, Description, Tags
- Replace `screenshot.png` and the rose mark in `assets/logos/` (the workflow renames those files but cannot redraw them)
- Give the theme its own palette in `theme.json`, or add a `styles/*.json` variation
- Add a `patterns/` directory if the fork needs one — the `@imwz/wp-pattern-sentinel` harness and the `npm run validate` scripts are already wired up for it

## Theme Integration for Aludra

The Aludra mega-menu block requires its host theme to register a `menu` template part area. Aviendha does this in `functions.php` via the `default_wp_template_part_areas` filter, so mega menu template parts created in the Site Editor appear under **Appearance → Editor → Patterns → Template Parts → Menus**.

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer run lint       # php-parallel-lint syntax check
composer run wpcs:scan   # PHPCS against phpcs.xml
composer run wpcs:fix    # PHPCBF auto-fix
```

No JS build step is required — the theme ships no bundled JavaScript.
